<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines In 1999 the Web Accessibility</span></h2>
<p>Initiative, a project by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 1.0. On 11 December 2008, the WAI released the WCAG 2.0 as a Recommendation. WCAG 2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral.</p>
<p>Though web designers can choose either standard to follow, the WCAG 2.0 have been widely accepted as the definitive guidelines on how to create accessible websites. Governments are steadily adopting the WCAG 2.0 as the accessibility standard for their own websites.</p>
<h3><strong>WCAG 1.0</strong></h3>
<p>The WCAG 1.0 was published and became a W3C recommendation on 5 May 1999. They<br />have since been superseded by WCAG 2.0.<br />WCAG 1.0 consists of 14 guidelines&mdash;each of which describes a general principle of<br />accessible design. Each guideline covers a basic theme of web accessibility and is<br />associated with one or more checkpoints that describe how to apply that guideline to<br />particular webpage features.</p>
<p><br /> Guideline 1: Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content</p>
<p><br /> Guideline 2: Don&rsquo;t rely on colour alone</p>
<p><br /> Guideline 3: Use markup and style sheets, and do so properly</p>
<p><br /> Guideline 4: Clarify natural language usage</p>
<p><br /> Guideline 5: Create tables that transform gracefully</p>
<p><br /> Guideline 6: Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully</p>
<p><br /> Guideline 7: Ensure user control of time sensitive content changes</p>
<p><br /> Guideline 8: Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces</p>
<p><br /> Guideline 9: Design for device independence</p>
<p><br /> Guideline 10: User interim solutions</p>
<p> Guideline 11: Use W3C technologies and guidelines</p>
<p> Guideline 12: Provide context and orientation information</p>
<p> Guideline 13: Provide clear navigation mechanisms</p>
<p> Guideline 14: Ensure that documents are clear and simple</p>
<p><br />Each of the in total 65 WCAG 1.0 checkpoints has an assigned priority level based on the<br />checkpoint's impact on accessibility:</p>
<p><br /> Priority 1: Web developers must satisfy these requirements, otherwise it will be<br />impossible for one or more groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this<br />level is described as A.</p>
<p><br /> Priority 2: Web developers should satisfy these requirements, otherwise some<br />groups will find it difficult to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is<br />described as AA or Double-A.</p>
<p><br /> Priority 3: Web developers may satisfy these requirements to make it easier for<br />some groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described<br />as AAA or Triple-A.</p>

<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is an approach to systems development that is focused on objects and the way that they interact. Objects surround us in the real world. Look around you. For example, I am a person, and I have a desk, a computer, and a cup of water; these are all objects. How do they interact? I sit at my desk, switch on the computer, and drink some water.</p>
<p>The objects identified above are unlikely to form part of any OOP system (unless you intend to produce a simulation). However, any systems that you develop will have objects. For example, a business will have customers, products, orders, and invoices. These objects will interact. Customers order products and pay invoices, products are restocked, and customers are chased for outstanding payments.</p>
<p>In this topic, you will look at how the OOP paradigm compares to the procedural paradigm. You will learn how to define objects and classes; the meaning of OOP terms such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism; and how to use UML to model your objects and their interactions.</p>

<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is an approach to systems development that is focused on objects and the way that they interact. Objects surround us in the real world. Look around you. For example, I am a person, and I have a desk, a computer, and a cup of water; these are all objects. How do they interact? I sit at my desk, switch on the computer, and drink some water.</p>
<p>The objects identified above are unlikely to form part of any OOP system (unless you intend to produce a simulation). However, any systems that you develop will have objects. For example, a business will have customers, products, orders, and invoices. These objects will interact. Customers order products and pay invoices, products are restocked, and customers are chased for outstanding payments.</p>
<p>In this topic, you will look at how the OOP paradigm compares to the procedural paradigm. You will learn how to define objects and classes; the meaning of OOP terms such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism; and how to use UML to model your objects and their interactions.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Structured programming</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines in contrast to using simple tests and jumps such as the go to statement, which can lead to &ldquo;<strong>spaghetti code</strong>&rdquo; that is potentially difficult to follow and maintain.<a class="footnote" title="Wikipedia: Structured programming" id="return-footnote-196-1" href="https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/structured-programming/#footnote-196-1" aria-label="Footnote 1"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a></p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>One of the most important concepts of programming is the ability to control a program so that different lines of code are executed or that some lines of code are executed many times. The mechanisms that allow us to control the flow of execution are called&nbsp;<strong>control structures</strong>. Flowcharting is a method of documenting (charting) the flow (or paths) that a program would execute. There are three main categories of control structures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sequence</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Very boring. Simply do one instruction then the next and the next. Just do them in a given sequence or in the order listed. Most lines of code are this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selection</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; This is where you select or choose between two or more flows. The choice is decided by asking some sort of question. The answer determines the path (or which lines of code) will be executed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iteration</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Also known as repetition, it allows some code (one to many lines) to be executed (or repeated) several times. The code might not be executed at all (repeat it zero times), executed a fixed number of times or executed indefinitely until some condition has been met. Also known as looping because the flowcharting shows the flow looping back to repeat the task.</li>
</ul>
<p>A fourth category describes unstructured code.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branching</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; An uncontrolled structure that allows the flow of execution to jump to a different part of the program. This category is rarely used in modular structured programming.</li>
</ul>
<p>All high-level programming languages have control structures. All languages have the first three categories of control structures (sequence, selection, and iteration). Most have the&nbsp;if then else&nbsp;structure (which belongs to the selection category) and the&nbsp;while structure (which belongs to the iteration category). After these two basic structures, there are usually language variations.</p>
<p>The concept of&nbsp;<strong>structured programming</strong>&nbsp;started in the late 1960&rsquo;s with an article by Edsger Dijkstra. He proposed a &ldquo;go to less&rdquo; method of planning programming logic that eliminated the need for the branching category of control structures. The topic was debated for about 20 years. But ultimately &ndash; &ldquo;By the end of the 20th century nearly all computer scientists were convinced that it is useful to learn and apply the concepts of structured programming.&rdquo;<a class="footnote" title="Wikipedia: Structured programming" id="return-footnote-196-2" href="https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/structured-programming/#footnote-196-2" aria-label="Footnote 2"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a></p>

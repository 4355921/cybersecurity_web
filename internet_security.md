<p>-Difference between passive and active security threats.</p>
<p><b>Active Attacks:</b><br />Active attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker efforts to change or modify the content of messages. Active Attack is danger for Integrity as well as availability. Due to active attack system is always damaged and System resources can be changed. The most important thing is that, In active attack, Victim gets informed about the attack.</p>

<p><b>Passive Attacks:</b><br />Passive Attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker observes the content of messages or copy the content of messages. Passive Attack is danger for Confidentiality. Due to passive attack, there is no any harm to the system. The most important thing is that In passive attack, Victim does not get informed about the attack.</p>
